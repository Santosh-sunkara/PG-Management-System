ma’am, this is Santosh from the RW Tool team and I am the Scrum Master for this week. Today, we presented our project integration to Prabhat sir, and he was impressed with our presentation. He also appreciated the team’s efforts and the progress we have made so far. Additionally, we divided the tasks related to UI issues and backend work among the team members. We are currently working on the UI issues, ER diagrams, and workflow today. Thank you for your guidance and support.
