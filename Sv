Subject: Justification for GitHub Finding ‚Äì SIR0277444

Dear Alfred,

This is in response to the GitHub finding raised under SIR0277444.

I would like to clarify that the uploaded content does not contain any business, client, or confidential data belonging to Standard Chartered. The file committed was part of a personal practice project (‚ÄúPG Management System‚Äù) and contained a placeholder message along with an automatically generated link. The intent was purely developmental and academic in nature, not related to any Standard Chartered project or data.

The SharePoint URL that appeared in the commit was inadvertently included during testing and does not expose or provide access to any business-sensitive information. It does not contain credentials, client data, or confidential project materials.

To remediate this, I have already taken down the content from the GitHub repository. Moving forward, I will ensure stricter checks to avoid any unintentional uploads and will keep my repositories free from any references to internal systems or links.

Please be assured that there was no business impact, no data leakage, and no Standard Chartered information disclosed through this upload.

Best regards,
Shiva Santosh

üëâ This justification:

Acknowledges the issue.

Clarifies no business/confidential data was uploaded.

Explains it was part of a practice project, not SCB work.

Mentions remediation (link taken down).

Reassures no business impact.

Would you like me to also make a shorter, risk-team‚Äìstyle version (more compliance tone, less narrative) so Alfred can just paste it back to the Cyber Defence team?
