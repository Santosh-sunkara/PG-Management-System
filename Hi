Subject: Clarification on Shared File

Dear [Supervisorâ€™s Name],

I would like to clarify regarding the recent issue with the uploaded file. The file link that appeared in the commit was originally shared by me with Santosh for practice purposes. The file itself contained only our assignment-related content and no Standard Chartered project, client, or confidential information.

The link I shared happened to carry my bank ID as part of the auto-generated path, and Santosh inadvertently copied it into the GitHub repository. This was purely unintentional and limited only to practice work.

We sincerely confirm that no business-sensitive information, credentials, or client data were involved. We understand the seriousness of this matter, and we assure you that such incidents will not be repeated. We will take extra care to ensure all future practice work remains fully separate from Standard Chartered references.

Sincerely,
Vasanth
